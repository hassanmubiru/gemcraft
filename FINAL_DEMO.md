## ðŸ“Š Demo Script

### Introduction (1 minute)
"Welcome to GemCraft, the first blockchain-integrated match-3 game with advanced mechanics! Today I'll show you the complete system with both advanced gameplay and real blockchain rewards."

### Blockchain Settings (2 minutes)
"First, let's look at the blockchain settings. GemCraft supports both mock and real blockchain modes. Mock mode is perfect for testing, while real mode uses actual Celo blockchain for real cUSD rewards and NFT minting."

### Advanced Mechanics (6 minutes)
"Now for the advanced mechanics. Watch how I create L-shaped patterns - this generates an explosive power-up that clears a 3x3 area. And when I match 5 gems, I get a color bomb that clears all gems of the same type. The game recognizes complex patterns automatically and creates cascading effects."

### Blockchain Rewards (4 minutes)
"Here's where it gets exciting - real rewards! When I complete a level, I can claim cUSD tokens. Notice how my performance affects the reward amount. I also have a chance to mint rare NFTs. Each NFT is unique with metadata including the level, score, and rarity."

### Performance System (2 minutes)
"See the star rating system? 3 stars gives me a 2x multiplier on rewards. The better I perform, the more I earn. This creates a skill-based earning system where strategy and performance directly impact rewards."

## ðŸŽ® Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Power-Up Discovery
- **Level**: 2 (Power-Up Discovery)
- **Objective**: Create your first power-up
- **Demo**: Match 4 gems horizontally to create row clear
- **Result**: Power-up clears entire row, triggers cascades

### Scenario 2: L-Shape Mastery
- **Level**: 4 (L-Shape Challenge)
- **Objective**: Master L-shaped patterns
- **Demo**: Create L-shaped match for explosive power-up
- **Result**: 3x3 area cleared, massive score boost

### Scenario 3: Color Bomb Factory
- **Level**: 6 (Color Bomb Factory)
- **Objective**: Create color bombs (5+ gems)
- **Demo**: Match 5+ gems for color bomb
- **Result**: All gems of same type cleared, huge score

### Scenario 4: Blockchain Rewards
