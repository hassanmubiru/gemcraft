## ðŸŽ® Demo Script

### Introduction (30 seconds)
"Welcome to GemCraft, the first blockchain-integrated match-3 game on Celo! Today I'll show you the advanced mechanics and real rewards system."

### Basic Mechanics (2 minutes)
"Let's start with Level 1. Notice how I can match 3 gems horizontally or vertically. The game uses advanced pattern recognition to detect matches."

### Power-Up Creation (3 minutes)
"Now for Level 2 - watch what happens when I create a 4-gem match. It creates a row clear power-up! And if I match 5 gems, I get a color bomb that clears all gems of the same type."

### Advanced Patterns (4 minutes)
"Level 4 introduces L-shaped patterns. When I create an L-shape, it generates an explosive power-up that clears a 3x3 area. The game recognizes complex patterns automatically."

### Blockchain Rewards (2 minutes)
"Now for the exciting part - real rewards! When I complete a level, I can claim cUSD tokens. Watch how my performance affects the reward amount. I also have a chance to mint rare NFTs!"

### Performance Bonuses (1 minute)
"Notice the star rating system. 3 stars gives me a 2x multiplier on rewards. The better I perform, the more I earn!"

### NFT System (1 minute)
"Look! I just minted a rare Ruby NFT! Each NFT has unique metadata including the level, score, and rarity. These are real collectible assets on the blockchain."
